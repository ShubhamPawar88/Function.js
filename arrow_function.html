         //1.when function consits of exactly one statement the arrow function should be written like below;

        let z1=(a,b) => a+b;
    
        document.write("<br>add="+z1(10,4));

         //2.when arrow function is having no argument
          //In below code , _ indicates function is having zero parameters
